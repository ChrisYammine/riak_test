3 directories, "cacert.org", "selfsigned", and "special".
Each contains several keys and a "ca" folder containing the CA certificate(s) used to sign them.

"cacert.org" contains certificates issued by cacert.org for names within the "cataclysm-software.net" domain.
These certificates have, as of this writing, all expired, and with the exception of tests for expired certificates they have been replaced with certs in the "special" directory.

"selfsigned" has a root CA, an intermediate CA, and 4 key/cert pairs:
* "site1" and "site2" are signed by an intermediate CA which was signed by the root CA.
* "site3" and "site4" are signed directly by the root CA.
The "subject" of certificates in this tree are detailed DNs.

"special" has a root CA and 2 key/cert pairs:
* "site5" and "site6" are signed directly by the root CA.
The "subject" of certificates in this tree are fully-qualified domain names.

The certificate common names are as follows:
 * site1.basho.com
 * site2.basho.com
 * site3.basho.com
 * site4.basho.com
 * site5.basho.com
 * site6.basho.com
